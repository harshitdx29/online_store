Flask framework is used to create the REST Api for an online store.

MongoDb is used as the database for storing information about the products in the store.
For demo purposes a product only has two fields identifying it:
  1) Product Id
  2) Product Name
More fields like Product Price, Quantity, Description can be added for actual scenarios.

The API supports 4 opertions:
1) Adding a new product: It will be a POST request accepting a JSON data for adding to data-base. Before adding it will check if the product already exists.

2) Modifying a Product: It will be a POST request taking a JSON Object containing product_id and product name. It will not change anything if the product name is not modified.

3) Deleting a Product: A POST request taking the product id as input and deleting the required product from the database.

4) Retreiving a Product/ all Products: A GET Request which will fetch the product baseed on the product id passed or all the products as required.

All the above operations are authenticated.

POSTMAN API client can be used to test the API.

Server:
It has two components:
  1) Application Data Model
  2) Resource Model

Client:
It is the client app consuming the REST API.

Server and Client communicate over HTTP Protocol.

The code is deployed on Heroku which can be accessed using https://api-online-shop.herokuapp.com/

Set up instructions as well as Request-Response Object are mentioned in README.md
